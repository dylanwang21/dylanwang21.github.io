# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Dylan Wang and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I was always interested in applying previously learned topics and subjects in computer science. For example, calculating average is widely used in math, chemistry, and many other subjects. Learning how to write functions and code that would calculate average using both negative and positive numbers, as well as decimals further struck my interest in applying real world applications to coding.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I was fascinated by the way I could use both numbers and letters to run a game of blackjack through coding. I was able to use functions that would first check if the input was a number or letter, then calculate a score and output it with a bust if it was over 21. I thought this was interesting because I was able to initiate letters such as A to a specific number value like 1 or 10 and use this number to create and calculate a score to be outputted.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I was interested in the way I could create code that can be read from a separate data source, such as another file and how it can detect whether words in the file were palindrome. I was able to create code that could read a word from both the beginning and end checking if it is a palindrome and also write code to implement this function to another file. This was interesting to me because by being able to access other data sources in my code, the amount of possibilities and data I can apply to my future projects become endless.
